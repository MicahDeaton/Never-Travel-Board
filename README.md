### Base Logic
You are firstly prompted at the homescreen, this is going to show you your saved travel destination board. If the user would like to make a new travel board, there is a "New Trip" button that the user can press to do so. Once a New Destination place has been prompted in the search bar by the user, there will be filters that the user can make to narrow down the search for places in said destination.
Once places have been chosen by the user, they will be tacked on the destination board, keeping it all in one seamless place!
